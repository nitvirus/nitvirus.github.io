Recently I did some research on TDD(Test driven development) in DRUPAL, along with
BDD(Behaviour Driven Development).

While TDD primarily focusses on writing and running and seeing tests fail the test before developing any
functionality.

@TODO: - write here about how we can implement unit testing using simpletest.
- codeception integration with drupal
- Behat integration with Drupal.
give examples
