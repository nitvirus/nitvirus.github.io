Hello,

Started with drupal 8.
Drupal 8 has got enough changes to make you believe you are a newbie again.
These changes are a bit less spotted in the frontend but at the backend these changes are 
enourmous. With many modules being ported to drupal 8 day by day it is getting easy to build a site
in drupal 8.

Some of the things that I knew, before I start this study:
1. Hooks were removed from drupal 8. Not all of it but only few are remaining.
2. OOPS concepts are being used. Namespace, classes, objects should be known to a person starting with drupal 8.
3. Twig tempate engine is used instead of phptemplate.
4. Views module get in core of drupal 8.
5. The folder structure has changed when you compare with drupal 7. Now core folder contains all the core files, you can place your modules and themes into site
