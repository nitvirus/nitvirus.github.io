Today we will be looking at the basic git commands that I use majorly.

1. `git add`  -- for the addition of a file/files/folder under the version control.

2. `git commit` - to stage the changes  
      -a
      -m
      --amend - to change the last git message

3. `git pull` -- to get the changes from the upstream repository to your local environment.

4. `git push` -- to send changes to the upstream repository

5. `git clone` -- copy a repository from upstream to your local system.

6. `git checkout` useful when changing to another branch, also get the change from upstream repository.
          -b -- creates a new repository.

7. `git merge`

8. `git rebase`

9. `git cherry pick --commitid`
