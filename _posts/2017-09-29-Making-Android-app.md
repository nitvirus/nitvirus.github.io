Hello,
Tonight a weird idea came to mind and I am kind of hooked into this one. I am goign to make an Android app, it would be a native one so I would be using some Java programming.
The idea is to sync the content that I will be posting here on `nitvirus.github.io` to show and sync on the android app as well.

I would be updating this page regularly to update where I am at this point and how much progress has been made.
I would start from tomorrow i.e. 30th sept. 2017.
<br />
Wish me luck.
Nitish Guleria.
