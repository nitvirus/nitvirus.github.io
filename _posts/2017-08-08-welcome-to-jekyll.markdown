I have started learning and experimenting with jekyll.
The idea came from a good friend of mine, how he had successfully been running his pages on
github.io you can find link to his blog here : http://xn----qtd2fqdgm0bn0ci4k.xn--h2brj9c
crazyrohilla.github.io


Right now what I have learnt:
(8/8/2017)
1. you need Ruby  to be installed into your system before installing jekyll into your system.
(9/8/2017)
2. Installing Ruby on your Windows machine can be really pain in the @$$.
3. once you install jekyll, you don't need any database to run the server/ local site
you can   just run jekyll serve to run the local setup.
4. New posts can be posted in the _post folder of you site root
5. Would be learning more about the formatting and how to write markup in jekyll.





 


@TODO: remove DEMO TEXT
You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
