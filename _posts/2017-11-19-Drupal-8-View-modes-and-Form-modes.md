Today we will be looking at view modes and form mode, why are these useful in drupal, where are these useful and when are these useful.

Display mode in drupal 8 consists of view modes and form modes.Both of these are Configurational entities, that means these integrates with CMI, have no fields attached, have schema attached and are different from content entities by these properties.

View Modes
------
This mode attaches with
1. content
2. custom blocks
3. comment
4. paragraph
5. taxonomy term
6. User


Form Modes
------
Like view modes, form modes are a way to create different field configurations with the same content entity bundle. Form modes allow for multiple sets of field widget orderings and customizations, just as view modes allow for different orderings and customization of field formatters.

In addition to form modes, form operations allow for defining which classes should be used for forms like a node delete form. The class used to delete a node is different from the class used to edit a node. Operations are defined in an entityâ€™s annotations.
