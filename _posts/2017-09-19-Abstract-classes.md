Abstract means: existing in thought or as an idea but not having a physical or concrete existence.<br />
<b>Abstract classes</b> in oops concept means that we have a psedu class which contains a psedu method inside it.<br />
An abstract class is a class that is only partially implemented by the programmer. It may contain one or more abstract methods. An abstract method is simply a function definition that serves to tell the programmer that the method must be implemented in a child class. A child class<b>extends</b> an abstract class.

<b>Interface </b>
A child class <b> implements</b> an Interface.
<li>
Functions are defined outside of classes, while Methods are defined inside of and part of classes.
